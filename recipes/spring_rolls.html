        <p>These Vietnamese spring rolls are a refreshing change from the usual fried variety and have become a family favorite. They are a great summertime appetizer and delicious dipped in one or both of the sauces.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>2 ounces rice vermicelli</li>
            <li>8 rice wrappers</li>
            <li>8 large cooked shrimp (peeled)</li>
            <li>2 leaves lettuce, chopped</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons chopped fresh mint leaves</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro</li>
            <li>1 1/3 tablespoons chopped fresh Thai basil</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Sauce Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>1/4 cup of water</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons fresh lime juice</li>
            <li>tablespoons white sugar</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons fish sauce</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoons garlic chili sauce</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons hoisin sauce</li>
            <li>1 teaspoons finely chopped peanuts</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil; stir in vermicelli pasta and return to a boil. Cook pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta is tender yet firm to the bite, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Fill a large bowl with warm water. Dip one wrapper into the hot water for 1 second to soften. Lay wrapper flat; place 2 shrimp halves in a row across the center, add some vermicelli, lettuce, mint, cilantro, and basil, leaving about 2 inches uncovered on each side. Fold uncovered sides inward, then tightly roll the wrapper, beginning at the end with lettuce. Repeat with remaining ingredients.</li>
            <li>For the sauces: Mix water, lime juice, sugar, fish sauce, garlic, and chili sauce in a small bowl until well combined. Mix hoisin sauce and peanuts in a separate small bowl.</li>
            <li>Serve rolled spring rolls with fish sauce and hoisin sauce mixtures.</li>
        </ol>
